# Item-Item-similarity-based-recommendation-system

In this project, I have worked on a recommendation system for recommending products ordered or added to the cart over a website.

The two approaches used here are:
 
 1. Popularity Based Recommender System - Baseline Model
 2. Item-Item-similarity-based-recommendation-system
 
 ToDo: Will do if I get some time after job and other personal Projects
 
 1. Trying out SVD++, Packages like (CRAB, Subscribe)
 2. Adding context to the recommendations
 
        
        
        For now, it is a non complex recommendation system which will be perfect for upgrading to more sophisticated systems.
